# Multiples of 3 and 5

### Problem Statement
- If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these
  multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

- Solution: 233168

### Techniques
1. Brute force technique: Loop through all the numbers, test if divisible by 3 or 5 and sum it up.
2. Using Language Constructs: Use brute force technique using python language constructs like lists and sets to simplify
   implementations.
3. Use arithmetic progression theory to find the sum in fixed time and space complexity. This will result in the fastest
   algorithm.

### Note
- None
